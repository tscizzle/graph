BACKLOG
=======

- allow removal of vertices and edges
    - UndirectedVertex remove edge
        - remove edge
            - doc
    - DirectedVertex
        - remove edge
            - doc
    - UndirectedGraph
        - remove edge
            - doc
        - remove vertex
            - doc
    - DirectedGraph
        - remove edge
            - doc
        - remove vertex
            - doc
- put build commands in REMEMBER.txt
    - for building/uploading docs
    - for building/uploading the code
- as done in networkx, return components of the graph as iterators so consumers are not limited by memory
- allow Undirected* objects to have self-edges
- allow vertices to hold arbitrary objects
    - 'name' becomes the __str__ output of the object
    - equality is based on the object
- allow edges to hold arbitrary objects? (at least weights?)
