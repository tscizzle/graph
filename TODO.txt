- allow removal of vertices and edges
- as done in networkx, return components of the graph as iterators so consumers are not limited by memory
- allow Undirected* objects to have self-edges
- allow vertices to hold arbitrary objects
    - 'name' becomes the __str__ output of the object
    - equality is based on the object
- allow edges to hold arbitrary objects? (at least weights?)
